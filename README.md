# Coin Toss Probability and Surface Analysis

**Course:** CSElec 01: Computational Science

**Activity:** Coin Toss Probability Simulation

This project analyzes the probability of coin flips to test for physical bias. We compared two specific variables, coin mass (5-Peso vs. 20-Peso) and surface friction (Wood vs. Tile), to observe their effect on the theoretical 50/50 outcome.

The primary objective is to visualize the Law of Large Numbers. We observe how experimental probability stabilizes as the sample size increases from a single group () to the full class dataset ().

## 🧪 Experiment Objectives

We collected binary data (Heads=1, Tails=0) across 15 groups to analyze the following:

1. **Coin Bias:** Testing if the heavier 20-Peso coin lands differently than the 5-Peso coin.
2. **Surface Bias:** Testing if the damping of wood versus the restitution of tiles changes the outcome.
3. **Convergence:** Observing if the Head/Tail ratio settled at 0.5 as the number of trials increased.

## 📂 Files and Visualizations

### 1. Group H & T (`group6.py`)

This script analyzes our specific group data. It compares 100 flips of a 5-Peso coin against 100 flips of a 20-Peso coin on a Wood surface.

### 2. Canvass H & T (`canvass.py`)

This script aggregates data by surface type. It compares the results of flips performed on Wood (Groups 1 to 8) against those performed on Tiles (Groups 9 to 15).

### 3. All H & T (`all.py`)

This script combines every flip from all 15 groups. It demonstrates the final convergence of the Law of Large Numbers using the complete dataset of 3100 points.

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy

```

2. **Run the scripts:**

```bash
python group6.py
python canvass.py
python all.py

```

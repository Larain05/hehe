# Coin Flip Bias & Probability Analysis

**Course:** CSElec 01: Computational Science  
**Activity:** Coin Toss Probability Simulation

This project analyzes the probability of coin flips (Heads vs. Tails) to test for physical bias. We compared two variables—**coin mass** (5-Peso vs. 20-Peso) and **surface friction** (Wood vs. Tile)—to see if they affect the theoretical 50/50 outcome.

The main goal is to visualize the **Law of Large Numbers**: observing how the probability stabilizes as the sample size grows from a single group ($N=200$) to the full class dataset ($N \approx 3000$).

## 🧪 Experiment

We collected binary data (Heads=1, Tails=0) across 15 groups to test three things:

1.  **Coin Bias:** Does the heavier 20-Peso coin land differently than the 5-Peso coin?
2.  **Surface Bias:** Does the high damping of wood vs. the restitution of tiles change the outcome?
3.  **Convergence:** Does the Head/Tail ratio actually settle at 0.5 over time?

## 📂 Files & Visualizations

### 1. Group 6 Analysis (`group6.py`)

Analyzes our specific group data, comparing 100 flips of a 5-Peso coin vs. a 20-Peso coin on a Wood surface.

### 2. Surface Comparison (`compare_surfaces.py`)

Aggregates data by surface type to compare the behavior of Wood (Groups 1–8) against Tiles (Groups 9–15).

### 3. Global Convergence (`all.py`)

Combines all 3000+ data points from all 15 groups to demonstrate the final convergence of the Law of Large Numbers.
